For final project, I want to make a music robot, which be controlled by light sensor. Basically the robot is a music player, turning on and off by hands gesture. If hands cover the sensor, the music is played. If move away hands, the music stops. And every time music is played randomly from music lists. 

Additionally, the music robot has a lights, the higher volume is, the lighter lights are.
